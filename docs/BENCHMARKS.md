# Benchmarks (v0.9, 2026-11-07)

Sizes are measured **after** a real compressor (Zstd level 19, Deflate level 9) on the raw blocks of the top
mip level. Raw BC1/BC4 = 4 bits/texel (bpt), BC5/BC7 = 8 bpt. PSNR is over the channels the format stores, as
a per-image mean. mipple RDO defaults: window 2048 bytes and 16 KiB chunks (BC7: 16 KiB and 64 KiB; BC1: 8 KiB window; BC5: 3072
bytes), 256 back-references (capped by the window: 192 for BC5), partial-span copies from the nearest 8, smooth scale 5 (ramping to 1 at channel std 14; since 0.9.18 4×, halved at std 12, which only the Oodle section below is measured with), max RMS ratio 10, min RMS 3. Machine: 2-core cloud VM; timings are only comparable within a table. Raw rows are in `bench-results/`.

## Base encoders vs competitors, one P-core (Kodak first 6)

`scripts/compete.py --threads 1 --base-only --affinity 0x1000 --repeat 3` on an Intel Core Ultra 7 155H:
every encoder pinned to one performance core (logical CPU 12) and timed with its own timer, keeping the
fastest of three runs per image. Note: on this CPU logical CPUs 2-9 and 20-21 are efficiency cores. A
competitor config counts as beaten when some mipple effort is at least as good (PSNR) and at least as fast. The
tables below are from development runs on the first 6 images; the committed rows are the all-24 run
(`bench-results/compete-kodak24-1t-p12/`, next section).

Timing notes: at these speeds an image takes about a millisecond, so mipple prints times with microsecond
precision (it printed 0.1 ms before, which quantized fast configs by ~15%). Every encoder starts from the
RGBA image inside its timed region: the harness used to build Intel ISPC's R8/RG8 input plane before
starting the clock, which the other encoders (stb_dxt, rgbcx, mipple) do not get; it is now filled inside
the timed loop with a plain strided copy. The harness still allocates and zeroes the output before timing,
while mipple's time includes allocating its output.

### BC7 top efforts vs bc7e u6

Interleaved, fastest of 2. Effort 8 adds bc7e-style "uber" refits
(least-squares fits from index sets with the extremes nudged inward and stretched, for every multi-subset
mode and mode 6) and refines every mode's best encoding and its two best partition candidates before the modes
compete; effort 9 refines every candidate.

| Config | PSNR (dB) | Time, 6 images (s) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| mipple e7 | 45.73 | 1.44 |
| **mipple e8** | **46.10** | **9.36** |
| bc7e u6 (`-u6`, bc7e.ispc) | 46.08 | 11.30 |

With that, every base-encoder configuration of every competitor in these runs is beaten on both PSNR and
speed by some mipple effort, for all four formats.

### RDO vs bc7enc_rdo

`bench-results/compete-kodak24-rdo/`: all 24 Kodak images, 20 threads per encoder. mipple effort 5 λ 0.25-8
against bc7enc_rdo's RDO at its top base level, λ 0.1-4 (BC7: bc7e u6 λ 0.05-1 and bc7enc.cpp `-e`). BD-rate of
mipple's curve (negative = fewer bits at equal PSNR; it does not depend on the thread count) and the range of
total encode times over each RDO sweep (base encode plus RDO, 24 images):

| Format | vs | Zstd-19 | Deflate-9 | mipple time (s) | competitor time (s) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BC1 | bc7enc_rdo rgbcx L18 | −26.8% | −23.9% | 7.8-11.7 | 11.9-13.3 |
| BC4 | bc7enc_rdo rgbcx hr5 | −20.0% | −18.4% | 4.1-5.9 | 8.3-9.4 |
| BC5 | bc7enc_rdo rgbcx hr5 | −26.1% | −23.8% | 6.6-9.8 | 10.8-12.3 |
| BC7 | bc7enc_rdo bc7e u6 | −31.5% | −29.2% | 17.1-28.5 | 51.8-57.8 |
| BC7 | bc7enc_rdo bc7enc.cpp -e | −30.5% | −28.6% | 17.1-28.5 | 38.1-44.4 |

Each format's RDO rows for both encoders were run together, interleaved per image, so each table row compares
like with like; the BC7 rows come from a later run with the far search (below), the BC1 rows from a later one with
far endpoints (below), the BC4 rows from a later one with frozen literal costs (below), the BC5 rows from a
later one with the localized search (below); mipple's rows were then rerun alone with the smooth weighting
below (bc7enc_rdo's rows are unchanged). BC5 is the closest: mipple's slowest setting (λ 0.25, 9.8 s) is 9% faster
than bc7enc_rdo's fastest (λ 2, 10.8 s). With the error floor at RMS 1.5 per channel instead of
3 (before `--min-rms`), BC4 was −11.0% and BC5 −16.1%; BC1 and BC7 are unchanged.

Every mipple RDO setting is faster than every bc7enc_rdo RDO setting of the same format, at better rate-distortion.
The wide search (256 back-references) became affordable through: field-level dedup (a previous block whose
endpoints or indices an earlier one already had adds no new re-index/refit candidate, and BC4/BC5 half results
are memoized by field value), fused bounded error kernels for BC1/BC4/BC5 (stop once the error cannot win; BC5
reuses the base block's half errors), partial spans only from the nearest 8 blocks, an exact lower bound on the
LZ cost to skip candidates that cannot win, and table-driven literal/length/offset costs. All of these except the
search width and the span distance leave the output byte-identical. BC7 spends the time it has left over on
context: an 8 KiB window and 64 KiB chunks (6 per Kodak image) instead of 2 KiB and 16 KiB took BC7 from
−23.7% / −20.8% to −28.4% / −26.7% at about 1.5× the time (12.2-18.9 s before).

Field-swap refinement (`--refine-back`, default 256 for BC1/BC4/BC7): after the search picks a block, try replacing
one of its fields (endpoints or indices) with that field of each of the previous 256 blocks, so a block can
take its endpoints from one earlier block and its indices from another. Kodak-24 BD-rate (`mipple check`): BC1
−0.98%, BC4 −0.39%; vs bc7enc_rdo BC1 −19.2% → −19.8%, BC4 −16.8% → −17.0%. It is off for BC5, where it gains
−0.17% at depth 32 and −0.31% at 256 for 4% and 20% more RDO time, which BC5 cannot spare against bc7enc_rdo.
BC7 splits each block into its two 8-byte halves (in mode 6, the most common RDO mode: mode, endpoints and P0;
then P1 and the indices) and reaches past the exhaustive copy depth to the whole window. Mode-6 halves are scored
exactly without a decode (a per-texel error table for each index when the low half is kept, per-texel weights
when the high half is). Kodak-24 BD-rate −0.12% at 1.07× the time, and the equal-RMSE gap to Oodle at λ 10-40
narrows from +2.3-4.0% to +1.8-3.1% (depth 1024 is no better and 1.2× the time).

Literal costs: the rate model used to learn its order-0 literal costs from the bytes emitted so far in the
chunk, so the first blocks of every chunk saw near-uniform 8-bit literals, and RDO's own copies skewed the
counts. BC4/BC5/BC7 now fix them per chunk from the chunk's base encoding: Kodak-24 BD-rate (`mipple check`)
BC4 −1.24%, BC5 −0.44%, BC7 −0.06% (Kodak-8); vs bc7enc_rdo BC4 −17.0% → −17.9%, BC5 −20.7% → −21.1%, at the
same or lower time. Variants that did no better: counting only bytes the parse codes as literals (BC4 −0.45%),
statistics over a sliding 2-8 KiB of base blocks or the whole image, and scaling the costs by 0.85 or 1.15. BC1
keeps the learned costs: frozen ones are even in `mipple check` (λ ≤ 4) but worse at λ 2-8, −19.8% → −19.2%
vs bc7enc_rdo.

Far endpoints (`--far-back`, default 1024 for BC1): beyond the 256-block search, try the endpoints of every
earlier block in the window (BC1's window is now 8 KiB, 1024 blocks), re-indexed for the current block. Oodle
Texture reuses endpoints from hundreds to thousands of blocks back, which a 256-block search cannot see. It is
made cheap by trying each distinct pair once, at its nearest position (a per-position "latest occurrence"
flag, no hashing in the scan), and only when a lower bound on its error leaves it a chance: the mean of any
indices' palette colors lies on the endpoints' segment, so the block error is at least 16 times the squared
distance from the block's mean color to that segment (less a slack for the truncated interpolation). About 1 in
5 distinct pairs passes; 3-color pairs are skipped. Kodak-24 BD-rate (`mipple check`) −0.55% for 1.09× the
time (2048 blocks with a 16 KiB window: −0.59%, 1.16×; trying every far block's endpoints and indices without
the bound: −0.69%, 4×); vs bc7enc_rdo −19.8% → −20.4%. Far index patterns (refit endpoints) add only
−0.17% at several times the cost. Not on by default for BC4, where the bound (each texel's distance from the
endpoint interval) passes too many pairs: −0.38% for 1.4× the time. BC5 is limited by depth instead.

Deeper BC5 search: BC5's window is now 3072 bytes, so its search reaches 192 blocks instead of 128 (Kodak-24
BD-rate −2.8%; 256 blocks: −3.6%). It became affordable by making each back-reference cheaper, all
byte-identical: BC4/BC5 candidates carry their exact error from generating them (whole-half copies, re-indexed
endpoints and refit indices are memoized per field value together with their error, and combined candidates
sum half errors), so losers are dropped before any decode; a half an earlier back-reference already had is
skipped outright; a re-index whose endpoint interval alone already loses is deferred until a combined
candidate needs it; and the LZ cost stops as soon as its bits exceed what could still win. Kodak-24 BC5 RDO
time at the old depth fell to 0.69× (BC4 0.9×), which pays for the 192-deep search; vs bc7enc_rdo BC5 went
from −21.1% to −23.5% at 7.4-9.2 s against its 9.7-11.2 s. Restricting the far half of the search to some
candidate types does not make it cheaper. A tighter LZ-cost lower bound (exact literal costs, matches only
where the 3-byte prefix occurs earlier) skipped almost nothing: RDO's candidates are copies, so they nearly
always contain a match.

Localized BC5 search (`--local`, default 16 for BC5): instead of the nearest 192 blocks, BC5 searches the nearest
128 plus 16 blocks picked from anywhere earlier in the chunk, plus the blocks around the one directly above
(±2). The picks are made in two steps: a shape distance (sum of absolute differences between the two blocks'
mean-removed 4×4 texels, both channels) keeps the 128 most similar, then a small neural network (23 features of
the pair: shape and level distances, base-block cost, distance, λ; one hidden layer of 16, ReLU) ranks those and
keeps 16. Every pick then goes through the normal exact candidate search, so the network only decides where to
look, never what is written. Inference is plain Rust (SSE2 with the scalar operation order, no FMA), so output
is identical on every machine; a unit test pins it to the scalar sum. The network was fitted
(`scripts/train_ranker.py`) only on CC0 textures from Poly Haven (`scripts/fetch_polyhaven.py`: every 27th
texture, 1k diffuse and normal maps; 323 encodes), never on Kodak or RAD's images. Ranked by the network, the
best back-reference is in the top 16 for 63% of blocks where one helps, against 50% for shape distance alone.
BD-rate: Kodak-8 −0.90%, Kodak-24 −0.76%, a disjoint Poly Haven held-out set −0.44%, at about the same time
(Kodak-24 1.02×); vs bc7enc_rdo BC5 went from −23.5% to −24.1% (Zstd-19), still faster at every setting.
`--local 0` restores the 192-deep search byte for byte.

Localized BC4 search (`--local`, default 32 for BC4, with `--max-back 128`): the same idea with a single-channel
ranker (`src/ranker/bc4.rs`). Beyond the nearest 128 blocks, 64 earlier blocks of the chunk by shape distance and
64 by value distance (exact integer SAD) go to a 13-16-1 network, which keeps 32; those and the blocks around the
one above get the exact search. Trained (`scripts/train_ranker_bc4.py`) only on single-channel images derived
from CC0 Poly Haven textures (324 encodes, 9.35M candidate rows). On a validation split the best block is in its
top 32 for 42% of groups against 41% for the best hand-made heuristic (min of refit residual and copy SSE) and 34%
for shape distance; end to end that heuristic gives −0.47% against the network's −0.67%. BD-rate against the old
256-deep search: held-out Poly Haven (48 images never used for tuning) −0.71% Zstd-19 / −0.85% Deflate, Kodak-24
−0.77% / −1.00%, at 0.95× the time (20 threads). `--local 0` restores the old search byte for byte.

BC7 far search (`--far-back`, now default 1024 for BC7, with a 16 KiB window): beyond the 256-block search, try
each earlier block in the window as a whole-block copy, and each distinct endpoint field re-indexed. Two exact
bounds keep it cheap: a copy is skipped when the difference of the two blocks' mean colors already costs more
than the best candidate (Cauchy-Schwarz), and a re-index when, in some subset, the mean texel is too far from
the endpoints' segment (as for BC1, now computed from the dequantized endpoints before any palette is built,
with the per-partition subset means cached per block). Re-indexing also stopped unpacking the index bits it
replaces. At the old settings BC7 RDO is byte-identical and 0.94× the time (Kodak-8). Kodak-8 BD-rate
(`mipple check`): −0.85% at 512 blocks for 1.07×, −1.46% at 1024 (16 KiB window) for 1.25×, −1.67% at 2048
(32 KiB); a wider window alone is neutral. Copies alone give −0.52% at 1024 almost for free. Kodak-24 vs
bc7enc_rdo: bc7e u6 −28.4% → −29.4%, `-e` −26.7% → −27.9%, at 22.8-34.0 s against 38.1-57.8 s.

Chunk boundaries cost little: on Kodak-24 BC5 (before frozen literals), 64 KiB chunks are −0.78% BD-rate
against the default 16 KiB and a single chunk per image −0.86% (BC1: −0.54%), but with 24 chunks per image on
20 threads larger chunks are slower (32 KiB: 13.3 s vs 10-12.5 s for λ 0.5 over the corpus). An earlier note
here put 64 KiB at −2.0%; that does not reproduce at the current defaults. Seeding each chunk's rate model with
the preceding blocks as the base encoder left them made it much worse (+2.9% at 16 KiB): RDO copies those
blocks, and the thread optimizing them changes many.

### BC7

`--repeat 2 --interleave` (per image, every config runs in rotation and keeps its fastest time, so load that
drifts over minutes hits all configs alike). Efforts 0-7 run
`src/bc7/fast.rs`, read straight from the surface: mode 6 (exact two-candidate indices, least-squares refits),
then mode 1 on 1-4 partitions per lane ranked by bc7f's popcount estimate or by line-fit error; from effort 4
±1 refinement of each lane's winner; at efforts 6-7 also modes 3, 0, 2 (3-subset partitions ranked the same
way) and dual-plane mode 5 (each color channel rotated into the scalar plane). Like the scalar encoder and
bc7e, opaque blocks pick p-bits by endpoint error, so alpha can decode as 254 (opaque images are scored on
RGB). Efforts 8-9 are the full encoders. Compressonator and texconv are not in this run (both were far behind
in the earlier runs).

Every effort now runs in the SIMD batch encoder (`src/bc1/batch.rs`). What each step is worth on
kodim01-03 (pooled PSNR):

| Search | PSNR (dB) |
| --- | --- |
| line fit + 2 refits (effort 1) | 36.12 |
| 4-color cluster fit, every split, snapped (old effort 4) | 36.54 |
| + 3-color fit with dark texels on black | 36.86 |
| same, splits scored by closed-form error only | 36.74 |
| line fit + 3-color fit only | 36.51 |

The 3-color fit is worth +0.3 dB on photos. Scoring splits with the closed-form least-squares error is 5×
cheaper but loses 0.12 dB, so the shipped scorer uses it as a bound and snaps only splits that can still win
(`prune` adds a share of the expected snapping penalty to the bound: 0.8 costs 0.02 dB and halves the time).
On kodim01 mipple's top effort beats rgbcx L18 on high-variance blocks and loses slightly on smooth ones.

## Base encoders vs competitors, all 24 Kodak images, one P-core

`bench-results/compete-kodak24-1t-p12/`, with `--threads 1 --base-only --affinity 0x1000 --repeat 3 --interleave`.
Every one of the 33 competitor configs is beaten on both PSNR and speed by some mipple effort. The last one to fall
was ISPC BC1 (`ispc_bc1`): mipple effort 0 is 0.34 dB better (36.05 vs 35.71) and now slightly faster (467 vs
450 Mpix/s; it was 3% slower before the change below). BC7: effort 8 beats bc7e u6 (46.02 dB in 33.4 s vs
46.01 dB in 38.7 s), and effort 6 beats ISPC `slow` (45.64 vs 45.63 dB, 6.6× faster).

The BC1 effort-0 speedup came from dependency chains, not arithmetic: the line fit summed 16 texels per
accumulator in one serial chain (mean, covariance, projection min/max, refit sums), about 64 cycles of latency
each, which out-of-order execution could not hide across ~1000-instruction batches. Four interleaved chains
per sum (`reduce16!` in `src/bc1/batch.rs`) give +11% in-process (444 → 490 Mpix/s), and a dedicated effort-0 instantiation with the configuration as a constant another ~4%. The covariance and
refit sums are now taken over raw integer products, which are exact in f32 in any order, so the output is
unchanged apart from rounding (BC1 BD-rate ±0.00% in `mipple check`). The helpers are macros, not closures:
a closure does not inherit the caller's AVX2 target feature, and one that was not inlined made effort 1 15×
slower.

Two fixes went into this run:

- `--interleave` keyed the fastest time per config by label alone, so configs with the same label in different
  formats (e.g. `mipple e0` in BC1 and BC7) shared one minimum. The key is now (format, label).
- BC1 built its single-color match tables on first use, which cost about 2 ms per process inside the timed
  encode (~10% of an image at effort 0). They are now `const` tables built at compile time.

## vs Oodle Texture 2.9.16 (Unreal Engine 5.8)

Oodle Texture is closed source, so `scripts/ue_oodle/run_ue_oodle.py`
drives a stock UE 5.8.4 install as a user would (no engine source, no direct DLL calls): it imports each PNG
once per format and Lossy Compression Amount (None, Lowest, Low, Medium, High, Highest = Oodle λ 0, 1, 10, 20,
30, 40), cooks with Final encode speed and RDO on, and takes Oodle's blocks from the cook's
`-OodleDebugDumpFilter` dumps, checked bit-exact against the cooked package and against the PNG Oodle was
given. The DDC key confirms SDK 2.9.16. `scripts/ue_oodle/compare.py` then scores those blocks and a mipple
-e 5 λ sweep on the same pixels, sizes Zstd-19 over the block data for both, and writes
`bench-results/oodle-ue/` (per-image rows in `results.json`). BC1 and BC7 inputs are the PNGs unaltered; BC4
is the R channel; BC5 goes through UE's normal-map import (renormalized XY as R16G16), so that R16G16 input is
the reference and mipple encodes it rounded to 8 bits.

mipple's size at Oodle's quality, relative to Oodle's size (Kodak-24 totals; negative = mipple smaller):

| Oodle λ | BC1 at RMSE | BC1 at SSIM | BC7 at RMSE | BC7 at SSIM | BC4 at RMSE | BC4 at SSIM | BC5 at RMSE | BC5 at SSIM |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | −18.9% | −9.4% | −6.5% (15/24 images) | −2.6% (4/24) | −13.4% | −5.4% | −31.1% | −11.3% |
| 1 | −15.1% | −6.8% | −2.9% (12/24) | −0.9% (4/24) | −4.0% | −1.7% | −4.5% | −1.8% |
| 10 | −11.5% | −7.5% | −1.9% | −3.9% | −6.6% | −2.1% | −10.7% | −4.2% |
| 20 | −11.0% | −7.3% | −1.7% | −2.8% | −9.6% | −3.2% | −15.7% | −5.7% |
| 30 | −11.3% | −6.9% | −2.3% | −2.4% | −12.6% | −4.3% | −19.0% | −6.3% |
| 40 | −11.5% | −6.7% | −3.2% | −2.0% | −15.1% | −5.1% | −21.2% | −6.7% |

All four are rerun at 4e8547d (the near-tie deferred decision, the neighbourhood smoothness weight, BC1
lookahead and the BC7 far-search gate; before it BC1 was −8.8% / −4.0% to −5.7% at λ 10-40 and BC7 −0.4% to
−1.3% at RMSE, −0.2% to −3.0% at SSIM), on top of mipple 0.9.18's smooth weight (4×, halved at channel std
12), BC4/BC5 RDO from an effort-8 base, and the BC7 speedups below. BC5's R16G16 input is rebuilt from the
PNG as UE's import does (XY of the normalized RGB, to 16 bits), which reproduces the recorded λ 0 scores exactly.

Speed (BC7, Core Ultra 7 155H): Oodle's CPU time is UE's process CPU time for a cook with an empty DDC minus
the same cook with a full one, about 62 CPU-seconds for Kodak-24 at λ 30 (High). mipple reaches that quality
at λ 1-1.5. BC7 RDO at λ 1 took about 104 CPU-seconds for Kodak-24 at 9c2eacf (one process per image on 6
pinned P-cores) and about 89 with the lighter second base (`bc7::rdo_alt_cfg`: the effort-8 plain search
kept beside the entropy-reduced base polishes one candidate per mode, not two, refines once, not twice, and
stretches uber index sets by one step, not three). The polish and refine cuts left the table above unchanged
at every λ (about 10% of the CPU time), the uber cut moved λ 30 at RMSE and λ 20 at SSIM by 0.1% (another 5%).
The ranker's prefilter then took eight candidate blocks at a time (byte-identical output, about 6% less, to
about 83 CPU-seconds; both builds encoding each image back to back on the same core), and mode-6 re-indexing
rejected more candidates on a per-texel lower bound before choosing indices (byte-identical, about 3% less).
The multi-subset rejection then stopped at the first subset that decides it, dequantizing only the endpoints it
reaches (byte-identical, about 5% less, to about 77). The far search's prefilter then also screened
multi-subset candidates before re-indexing them: the endpoint channels fully inside a candidate's first 64 bits
(the rest come from the current block) pin each endpoint to within half a quantization step, and a subset's
mean texel too far from that segment rejects (byte-identical, about 2% less), and mode-6 re-indexing chose
all 16 indices at once with AVX2 (the same projection, window and ties; byte-identical, about 2.5% less, to
about 80). BC7 block packing, unpacking and decoding then got one copy per mode, so each mode's bit layout
unrolls to fixed shifts (byte-identical, about 5% less, to about 75). The fast encoder's 2- and 3-subset
candidates (the plain alternate base) then encoded their subsets in lockstep, one indexing pass for all of them
(byte-identical, about 2.5% less), and BC7 skipped the Zstd check for chunks the rate model says shrank to 0.6
or less, which on Kodak-24 never fail it (byte-identical there; about 1% less at λ 1, to about 73, and 5% at λ 10).
The far search then re-indexed only mode-6 heads, dropping the multi-subset prefilter above: those far
re-indexings almost never won, and every Kodak-24 delta against Oodle moved by 0.02% or less (only λ 20 at
RMSE changes in the table, −0.4% to −0.3%), for about 5% less CPU at λ 1 and 1% at λ 10. Each mode-6 block's
two palettes are now also built once, when it is finished, not for every later block that re-indexes it
(byte-identical). The Zstd check then looked at level 1 first, skipping level 19 for chunks at most 0.9 of the
base's size there (byte-identical, about 2.5% less at λ 1), and the ranker's prefilter passed it 8 blocks per
key, not 16 (λ 20 SSIM, λ 30 SSIM and λ 40 change by 0.1% in the table, each cell by at most 0.07%; about 2%
less). The second base then skipped mode 3, which survives RDO in about 1 block in 12 of those it wins there:
no cell moved by more than 0.05%, the larger moves gains (λ 20 at RMSE −0.3% to −0.4%), for about 6.5% less
CPU at λ 1 and 3.7% at λ 4. It then refit endpoints once, not twice, and skipped mode 5 (no cell moved by
more than 0.01% at RMSE, SSIM gains up to 0.03%; 3.4% less at λ 1). Three cuts followed, byte-identical on Kodak-24: index-copy
and layout-copy refits whose least-squares bound already exceeds the error bound are skipped (about 2% less at
λ 1), the far search re-indexes only each distinct head's latest block in its range (3.5% less), and the final
one-field refinement of a mode-6 block no longer tries other modes' first halves over its indices (about 3% less
at λ 1; those never won on Kodak-24 or the Poly Haven test set, and one synthetic mask moved by 0.2% in size at a 0.01 dB
better PSNR). Chained, these paired measurements
seemed to put mipple at or slightly under Oodle's CPU time for the same size and quality (about 0.92-1.01× of the 62
CPU-seconds above), but a fresh side-by-side run at b99ffa3 does not bear that out. Oodle's share of a cook, taken as a
texture-only cook (fresh imports, shaders already in the DDC) minus a cook with a full DDC, was about 47 CPU-seconds
(four texture-only cooks at 90.6-101.9 against 46.6-53.6 with a full DDC) and 2-3 s of wall time. mipple at λ 1 and
1.5, which bracket Oodle's λ 30 RMSE, used 55-64 CPU-seconds encoding the 24 images one after another with all
threads (13-14 s wall), 76-98 encoding all 24 at once with one thread each (5.7-6.9 s wall), and 33 s on one pinned
P-core. CPU-seconds on this hybrid, hyperthreaded CPU depend heavily on load, so both were then measured on one
pinned P-core (core 16; UE widens its own affinity at start, so its processes were re-pinned every 100 ms). The
texture-only cooks took 51.5-55.4 CPU-seconds against 31.8-33.9 with a full DDC, which puts Oodle's share at about
20-22 CPU-seconds (three pairs). mipple encoding the 24 images at λ 1 (`encode`, one process per image, KTX2
output) took 34.2-34.6. On the same core, mipple's BC7 RDO costs about 1.6× Oodle's CPU for smaller files at the
same quality. Both bases then kept mode 6 for near-flat blocks: the plain effort-8 base skips the multi-subset
search and mode-6 polish when the block's mode-6 error is at most 384 (`busy_err`), and the entropy-reduced base
when its weighted mode-6 score is at most 512. Those blocks then share one mode-6 layout that later blocks can
copy, so files shrink and the quality table gains (λ 20-40 at SSIM −2.5%, −1.8%, −1.5% to −2.8%, −2.4%, −2.0%;
λ 40 at RMSE −3.1% to −3.2%; λ 10 and below unchanged, since the gates only apply at λ ≥ 1). On 8 Kodak images
at λ 1 on one pinned P-core (interleaved, per-image best of five) the bases took 1.04 s instead of 2.71 and the
whole encode 10.48 s instead of 12.00 (−12.6%), with 2.3% smaller files. Kodak-24 at λ 1 (`encode`, one
process per image) now takes 31.2-31.6 CPU-seconds on one pinned P-core, about 1.5× Oodle's share.

mipple is now smaller at both of Oodle's quality measures at every λ in every format. Per image it is not a
sweep: BC1 loses 1 of 288 image/λ/metric cells (kodim05 at λ 40 on SSIM, +0.3%); BC7 at λ 10-40 is behind on
RMSE for 10 of 96 image/λ pairs (up to +0.8%, kodim08) and on SSIM for 19 (up to +4.1%, kodim20, kodim19 and
kodim09, smooth-sky images where Oodle's RDO keeps more structure at λ 30-40); BC4 and BC5 are behind on RMSE
in 4 and 2 of 120 image/λ pairs at λ 1-40 (up to +0.4%, +0.6%), but on SSIM in 14 and 22: BC4 most on kodim18
and kodim05 (about +4% at λ 20-40), BC5 on kodim02 and kodim13 (up to +6.7%).

BC5 λ 1 was the last cell behind (+4.0%, then +2.6% after the smooth-weight change, 22 of 24 images reaching
Oodle's RMSE): Oodle's λ 1 is more accurate than its own λ 0, and mipple's -e 5 base (endpoint window radius 1)
could not reach it. RDO now starts BC4/BC5 from an effort-8 base (radius 4, `base_block_opts` in
`src/pipeline.rs`), as BC7 does: BC5 λ 1 −4.1% (all 24 images), λ 10-40 −9.8% to −20.1%; BC4 λ 1 −1.1% →
−3.8%. Kodak-24 BD-rate BC4 −0.95%, BC5 −1.20% at the same encode time (the base is a few ms next to RDO).

BC7 was the gap: Oodle 2.9.16 held 2-3% fewer bits at equal RMSE at λ 10-40 until the smooth-weight change
(last item below). Its non-RDO BC7 is more
accurate than mipple's -e 5 base, so at λ 0-1 mipple's curve only reaches Oodle's RMSE on some images (counts
in brackets); at -e 8 or 9 without RDO mipple is as accurate as Oodle's λ 0 on 5 of those 6 images and
smaller on all 6 (kodim03: RMSE 1.650 at 6.85 bpt vs Oodle's 1.623 at 7.30), so the gap is in the RDO search,
not the base encoder. It was 7-9% (+8.2%,
+8.8%, +8.3%, +6.9%) before four RDO changes, which the first 6 images (kodim03, 05, 08, 13, 18, 24) sized:

- the plain search runs at effort 8 or more whenever RDO is on (`RDO_BASE_EFFORT` in `src/pipeline.rs`; base
  time 11 ms → 241 ms per Kodak image, next to 1.5-3 s of RDO). At λ below 1 (no entropy reduction) that is
  the base itself, and Oodle's λ 10 quality sits there: +11.0% → +2.0% at λ 10. Most of the gain.
- with an entropy-reduced base (λ ≥ 1), that plain encoding is a second base: each block starts from
  whichever of the two scores better (+9.4% → +8.5% at -e 5 before the effort floor).
- a cross-mode candidate: an earlier block (within 8, or the one above) whose mode or partition differs is
  tried with this block's endpoints refit to its layout, so mode, partition and index bits match exactly
  (+8.5% → +8.3%; every earlier block gives +8.1% at a quarter more RDO time at λ 1).
- a mode-6-only encode (`bc7::mode6_cfg`, 2 refits) as a further base, since Oodle's RDO output is 70-80% mode
  6: on the 6 images +3.9% → +2.8% at RMSE and −2.4% → −3.5% at SSIM (with the learned ranker); Kodak-24
  BD-rate −0.22% vs the ranker alone at 1.06× the time. 128 KiB chunks would add another −1.0% to −1.3% BD-rate
  at the same CPU time (6-image Oodle subset: +2.1% / −4.5%), but fewer, longer chunks leave threads idle: 1.4-1.5×
  the wall time at 20 threads, so BC7 chunks stay 64 KiB.
- the smooth-block weight's shape (all formats). The linear ramp gave flat blocks 5× and blocks at channel std
  14 or more nothing, so gradual-but-textured blocks got no protection while the flattest were over-weighted:
  turning the weight down only moved error from SSIM to RMSE (`--smooth-scale 1` +2.1% / +7.5%, 2.5 +2.0% /
  +1.6% on the 6 images). `1 + (scale − 1) · k² / (k² + σ²)` keeps a tail of protection for busy blocks:
  Kodak-24 BC7 λ 10-40 at RMSE went from +2.0%, +3.1%, +2.5%, +1.8% to −1.1%, −0.6%, −0.9%, −1.5%, at SSIM
  from −5.1% … −2.3% to −3.1% … −0.3%; BC1 and BC4 gain 2-4% at RMSE and give back up to 1.7% of their SSIM
  lead. Scale 3 at k 12 is further ahead on RMSE but behind on SSIM at λ 30-40 (+0.4%, +0.8%); 4 is the
  lowest that stays ahead on both. `mipple check`: BD-rate −1.2% to −2.8% (synthetic), −3.8% (BC7 Kodak-4)
  at the same speed.

On those 6 images, mean of λ 10-40 at RMSE / SSIM: -e 5 +9.4% / −2.7% before the first four changes, +4.0% /
−2.2% after; -e 9 is the same as -e 5.

At λ 1 Oodle comes out both more accurate and smaller than its own λ 0 (BC5: RMSE 2.687 at 5.69 bpt vs 2.756
at 7.43); mipple's BC4 and BC5 are now ahead there too (−3.8% / −1.1%, −4.1% / −0.7%).
The crop of kodim18 alone (0.9.16 numbers) is behind at equal SSIM for BC4 and BC5:
kodim18 (512×512 crop), at RMSE / at SSIM: BC4 −5.2% / −1.5% at λ 0, then +2.8% / +4.8%, +1.2% / +6.2%,
+0.2% / +6.7%, −0.6% / +6.6% at λ 10-40; BC5 −28.9% / −8.7% at λ 0, +5.6% / +3.8% at λ 1, then −7.3% / +2.3%,
−12.2% / +1.0%, −14.8% / +0.4%, −17.2% / +0.7% at λ 10-40. BC1 kodim18: −7.3% at λ 0, −0.8% to −1.8% at λ 10-40 on
RMSE, −2.6% to −4.8% on SSIM.

## BC3 vs bc7enc_rdo

Twelve RGBA images: Kodak 1, 3, 5, 13, 18 and 23, each with alpha from the next Kodak image's luma (detailed
alpha) and with a smooth radial alpha that reaches 0 in the corners. mipple effort 5 with `--alpha data` (so all
four channels are scored against the source) against bc7enc_rdo `-3` (rgbcx L18 color, BC4 alpha at radius 5)
with `-zc8192`, all threads, top level only. PSNR is over RGBA, bits/texel after Zstd-19 and Deflate-9, and time
is the total wall time over the twelve images, process start included:

BD-rate of the mean curves: −16.0% after Zstd-19, −14.4% after Deflate-9. Every mipple RDO point is both smaller
and closer to the source than the bc7enc_rdo point at the same λ, at about a fifth of the time. (The times are
from an earlier run of the same commands on an earlier build of these twelve images; sizes and PSNR are from the
current images.) The base encoders are even: the color half is the BC1 encoder held to 4-color blocks (a BC3
color half never decodes in 3-color mode), the alpha half the BC4 encoder.

## BC6H vs ISPC, texconv, Compressonator

Twenty Poly Haven HDR environment maps at 1024×512 (`scripts/fetch_polyhaven.py --hdris --step 50`), unsigned
BC6H (`BC6H_UF16`), one thread for every encoder, pinned to one P-core, `python scripts/compete_bc6h.py
test-images/polyhaven-hdri --threads 1 --cpu 14 --runs 3 --efforts 0,1,2,5,9`. Scores are in linear light:
mPSNR is multi-exposure PSNR (Munkberg et al. 2006) over each image's exposure range, log2 RMSE is roughly
the error in stops. Means per image; time is the total over the twenty images (best of three per image for
mipple's encode loop and the ISPC harness's block loop; process wall time for texconv and Compressonator,
which includes loading and writing):

| encoder | mPSNR dB | log2 RMSE | Zstd-19 bpt | time s |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| mipple effort 0 | 44.951 | 0.04983 | 7.215 | 0.120 |
| mipple effort 1 | 46.713 | 0.03980 | 7.388 | 0.475 |
| mipple effort 2 | 46.873 | 0.03901 | 7.387 | 0.784 |
| mipple effort 5 | 47.022 | 0.03830 | 7.392 | 2.14 |
| mipple effort 9 | 47.117 | 0.03785 | 7.400 | 64.1 |
| ISPC veryfast | 44.857 | 0.05035 | 7.213 | 0.127 |
| ISPC fast | 46.586 | 0.04034 | 7.370 | 0.897 |
| ISPC basic | 46.745 | 0.03959 | 7.359 | 2.21 |
| ISPC slow | 46.838 | 0.03916 | 7.402 | 9.26 |
| ISPC veryslow | 46.848 | 0.03912 | 7.409 | 19.7 |

| Compressonator q0.1 | 45.944 | 0.04552 | 7.239 | 161 |
| Compressonator q1.0 | 45.944 | 0.04552 | 7.243 | 2985 |

(Compressonator's rows are from an earlier, unpinned run with the same images; it is far off the pace either
way.)

mipple encodes eight blocks at a time, one per SIMD lane, as ISPC does. Every ISPC profile has a mipple
effort that is both better and faster:

- Effort 0 (one region, the refit keeps the indices) is 0.09 dB ahead of ISPC veryfast, and 6% faster.
- Effort 1 is 0.13 dB ahead of ISPC fast in 53% of its time.
- Effort 2 is 0.13 dB ahead of ISPC basic in 35% of its time, and ahead of ISPC veryslow (+0.03 dB) in 4% of
  its time.
- Effort 5 is 0.17 dB ahead of every competitor setting, in 2.1 s.

Without RDO, Zstd sizes are within 0.5% of each other for every encoder at matching quality.

### BC6H RDO

`--lambda` runs an RDO pass over the effort-5 blocks. Distortion is the squared error of the half-float bit
patterns, which is close to relative (log) error, so a λ means the same at every exposure. Each block tries
whole-block copies from the last 256 blocks, the endpoints of the last 256 blocks with its own indices
re-chosen, and the indices of the last 32 blocks with least-squares endpoints refit to them. It scores each
candidate with the same LZ rate model as the 8-bit formats. Same twenty images, totals of the Zstd-19 KTX2
files (no mips), `--zstd 19` so the pass checks its chunks against Zstd:

| λ | file bytes | vs λ 0 | mPSNR dB | log2 RMSE |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 0 | 9,693,737 | | 47.022 | 0.03830 |
| 1 | 6,209,485 | -35.9% | 45.782 | 0.04260 |
| 2 | 5,570,380 | -42.5% | 44.980 | 0.04646 |
| 4 | 4,870,733 | -49.8% | 43.854 | 0.05284 |
| 8 | 4,149,481 | -57.2% | 42.382 | 0.06290 |
| 16 | 3,455,613 | -64.4% | 40.570 | 0.07824 |

At λ 2 the files are 42% smaller than plain effort 5, at the quality of effort 0 or ISPC veryfast. None of the
other BC6H encoders here has an RDO mode. Refitting endpoints to borrowed indices is worth 3.2% BD-rate
against re-indexing alone. Looking back 32 blocks for refits instead of 256 costs 0.3% BD-rate for about half
the RDO time.

## ETC2 and EAC vs Compressonator

ETC2 RGB on all 24 Kodak images, one thread for every encoder, top level only, `python scripts/compete_etc.py
test-images/kodak --threads 1`. Compressonator 4.6.0 (`-fd ETC2_RGB`; `-Quality` and `-CompressionSpeed`
change nothing on its ETC2 path) is the only ETC2 encoder on disk: etcpak and etc2comp could not be built
here, so they are not graded. PSNR is over RGB, bits/texel after Zstd-19, and time is the total over the 24
images (mipple's encode loop; process wall time for Compressonator, which includes loading and writing):

| encoder | PSNR dB | SSIM | Zstd-19 bpt | time s |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| mipple effort 0 | 37.074 | 0.97850 | 3.056 | 4.4 |
| mipple effort 1 | 37.640 | 0.98090 | 3.066 | 18.2 |
| mipple effort 2 | 37.660 | 0.98091 | 3.068 | 20.7 |
| mipple effort 3 | 37.697 | 0.98096 | 3.071 | 31.2 |
| mipple effort 5 | 37.728 | 0.98099 | 3.073 | 43.1 |
| mipple effort 7 | 37.756 | 0.98102 | 3.079 | 77.1 |
| mipple effort 9 | 37.776 | 0.98104 | 3.081 | 131 |
| Compressonator | 36.700 | 0.98103 | 3.013 | 33.6 |

Effort 0 (ETC1 modes and planar only, two exact candidates per subblock) is 0.37 dB ahead of Compressonator
in an eighth of its time; effort 1 adds T and H and is 0.94 dB ahead in half its time. Compressonator's blocks
are 1.4% smaller after Zstd at λ = 0, which the RDO pass more than recovers (below).

ETC2 RGBA8 on the twelve RGBA images of the BC3 section (Kodak 1, 3, 5, 13, 18 and 23 with luma and radial
alpha), `--alpha data`, one thread, RGBA PSNR:

| encoder | PSNR dB | SSIM | Zstd-19 bpt | time s |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| mipple effort 0 | 37.254 | 0.97968 | 5.898 | 3.3 |
| mipple effort 1 | 37.818 | 0.98184 | 5.905 | 12.8 |
| mipple effort 5 | 37.903 | 0.98195 | 5.909 | 26.0 |
| mipple effort 9 | 37.951 | 0.98201 | 5.916 | 73.4 |
| Compressonator | 36.793 | 0.98154 | 5.339 | 20.7 |

Here Compressonator's files are 10% smaller at λ = 0: mipple's alpha blocks are closer (radial alpha comes
out exact, against 50 dB) but pick their table and multiplier per block, which Zstd finds less repetitive.

RDO (effort 5, all threads, same images and scoring; bits/texel after Zstd-19 and Deflate-9):

| λ | ETC2 RGB PSNR | ETC2 RGB Zstd bpt | ETC2 RGB Deflate bpt | ETC2 RGBA PSNR | ETC2 RGBA Zstd bpt | ETC2 RGBA Deflate bpt |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 0 | 37.728 | 3.073 | 3.164 | 37.903 | 5.909 | 6.123 |
| 0.25 | 37.718 | 2.989 | 3.080 | 37.821 | 5.238 | 5.422 |
| 0.5 | 37.675 | 2.882 | 2.972 | 37.713 | 4.948 | 5.126 |
| 1 | 37.545 | 2.703 | 2.792 | 37.478 | 4.600 | 4.782 |
| 2 | 37.225 | 2.479 | 2.569 | 36.988 | 4.188 | 4.370 |
| 4 | 36.497 | 2.174 | 2.266 | 36.053 | 3.693 | 3.870 |
| Compressonator | 36.700 | 3.013 | 3.111 | 36.793 | 5.339 | 5.610 |

At Compressonator's PSNR, mipple's files are about 25% smaller for ETC2 RGB and 23% smaller for ETC2 RGBA after
Zstd, 25% and 24% after Deflate (interpolating between λ 2 and 4); at λ 0.5 ETC2 RGB is 4% smaller and 1 dB
closer. The RDO candidates per 8-byte half are whole-block and whole-half copies, another block's colors with
the selectors re-chosen, another block's selectors with the base colors and tables refit (individual and
differential blocks), and for EAC another block's base, multiplier and table re-indexed or its indices refit.
The RDO pass takes about 1.7 s per Kodak image on all threads (a machine shared with other builds), several
times BC1's: ETC candidates are scored by a full decode.

EAC R11 and RG11 have no competitor on disk (Compressonator has no EAC-only formats). On Kodak, one thread,
R11 from the red channel and RG11 from red and green, PSNR over those channels:

| encoder | R11 PSNR | R11 bpt | R11 s | RG11 PSNR | RG11 bpt | RG11 s |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| mipple effort 0 | 44.412 | 3.694 | 2.2 | 44.372 | 7.114 | 4.0 |
| mipple effort 2 | 45.011 | 3.694 | 8.4 | 44.974 | 7.130 | 15.7 |
| mipple effort 5 | 45.106 | 3.698 | 13.2 | 45.066 | 7.138 | 25.1 |
| mipple effort 9 | 45.208 | 3.701 | 23.2 | 45.167 | 7.157 | 47.2 |

## ASTC vs ISPC and astcenc

ASTC LDR on all 24 Kodak images, top level only, on a throwaway GitHub Actions runner (AMD EPYC 9V74, 4
logical CPUs) with every encoder on one thread pinned to CPU 1: `gh workflow run bench.yml -f head=<full sha>
-f efforts=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 -f astcenc=fast,medium,thorough -f runs=3` (`.github/workflows/bench.yml`, which
runs `scripts/compete_astc.py`). The encoders are mipple 6727c53; Intel's ISPC Texture Compressor 79ddbc9 built
with ISPC 1.32.0 (`ispc_astc:<W>x<H>` in `bcn_harness`, its fast profile, the only ASTC profile it has for
opaque images); and Arm's astcenc 5.7.1 (the prebuilt AVX2 release, `-cl`, presets fast / medium / thorough).
All encode for linear decoding and are scored by `mipple score --astc-linear`: PSNR over RGB, luma SSIM, and
bits/texel after Zstd-19 and Deflate-9. Time is the sum over the images of each image's best of three runs:
mipple's encode loop, the harness's block loop, astcenc's own "Coding time" line (none include loading or
writing files). Runner CPUs differ from run to run, so times compare only within one run; this table is one
run:

| footprint | encoder | PSNR dB | SSIM | Zstd-19 bpt | Deflate-9 bpt | time s |

Every astcenc preset is beaten in PSNR and SSIM, in less time, at every footprint:

- **fast:** effort 1 at 4x4 (+0.20 dB in 83% of its time; effort 0 is 0.025 dB behind in 67% with files 1.7%
  smaller), effort 0 at 6x6 (+0.002 dB, SSIM 0.98530 against 0.98337, in 61%) and at 8x8 (+0.23 dB in 46%).
  astcenc fast's files are smaller after Zstd at 6x6 and 8x8 (effort 0's are 2.6% / 7.9% larger).
- **medium:** effort 2, +0.19 / +0.11 / +0.03 dB at 4x4 / 6x6 / 8x8 in 75% / 83% / 55% of its time; files
  0.5% / 2.7% / 4.1% larger after Zstd.
- **thorough:** effort 3 at 4x4 (+0.05 dB in 44% of its time, files 0.4% smaller), effort 4 at 6x6 (+0.004
  dB in 41%, files 0.3% larger) and effort 5 at 8x8 (+0.008 dB in 65%, files 0.4% larger). Effort 7 leads it
  by 0.35 / 0.18 / 0.07 dB in 2.8× / 1.6× / 1.2× its time.

Against ISPC fast, effort 0 is 0.77 / 0.10 / 0.26 dB ahead at 4x4 / 6x6 / 8x8 with higher SSIM, in 91% / 89%
/ 90% of its time, with files 2.7% / 1.4% / 0.1% smaller after Zstd.

Scoring astcenc's files exposed a decoder bug, fixed: a 2- or 3-partition block may spell equal CEMs the long
way (with the extra CEM bits below the weights), and the decoder read those blocks with the short form's
endpoint range. mipple's own files never use the long form, so earlier mipple scores are unchanged.

RDO at effort 0 on the same images, run locally on one thread pinned to one P-core of the Core Ultra 7 155H
(logical CPU 4), `mipple bench test-images/kodak -f astc-4x4,astc-6x6,astc-8x8 -l 0,0.5,1,2,4,8 -e 0` with
`RAYON_NUM_THREADS=1`. Each cell is PSNR dB / SSIM / Zstd-19 bpt; the RDO pass's time is its total over the 24
images. The λ 0 rows are the cloud table's effort-0 encodes:

| λ | 4x4 | 6x6 | 8x8 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 44.56 / 0.99746 / 7.091 | 37.66 / 0.98530 / 3.287 | 33.91 / 0.96247 / 1.879 |
| 0.5 | 43.07 / 0.99357 / 5.121 (65 s) | 37.67 / 0.98444 / 2.940 (40 s) | 33.99 / 0.96256 / 1.755 (34 s) |
| 1 | 41.56 / 0.98669 / 4.262 (60 s) | 37.48 / 0.98185 / 2.667 (41 s) | 33.96 / 0.96147 / 1.656 (35 s) |
| 2 | 39.76 / 0.97634 / 3.566 (59 s) | 37.02 / 0.97464 / 2.276 (38 s) | 33.86 / 0.95828 / 1.497 (33 s) |
| 4 | 37.57 / 0.95926 / 2.952 (58 s) | 36.30 / 0.96467 / 1.954 (37 s) | 33.65 / 0.95195 / 1.323 (31 s) |
| 8 | 34.87 / 0.92572 / 2.276 (55 s) | 35.09 / 0.94662 / 1.638 (36 s) | 33.24 / 0.94127 / 1.159 (31 s) |
| ISPC fast | 43.79 / 0.99677 / 7.286 | 37.56 / 0.98365 / 3.332 | 33.65 / 0.95837 / 1.881 |

At ISPC fast's PSNR (interpolated in log rate along each λ curve's Pareto front), mipple's files are 17.7% /
16.6% / 29.8% smaller at 4x4 / 6x6 / 8x8 after Zstd-19, and 17.1% / 16.1% / 29.1% smaller after Deflate-9
(ISPC fast: 7.431 / 3.368 / 1.896 bpt; mipple λ 0: 7.260 / 3.334 / 1.897; λ 1: 4.429 / 2.715 / 1.676). At 6x6
and 8x8, light RDO raises PSNR (0.01 / 0.08 dB at λ 0.5): a polished re-weight or refit of an earlier block is
sometimes closer to the source than effort 0's own encode of the block. The candidates are whole copies of the
previous 256 blocks, an earlier block's head (mode, partition, endpoints) with the weights re-chosen, and an
earlier block's weights with the endpoints refitted, each polished once. Exact error lower bounds skip most of
them without changing the output: from each channel's summed difference for a whole copy, from the texels'
mean distance to each endpoint segment for a re-weight, and from the per-pair least-squares residual for a
refit, whose weight sums are cached with the earlier block. The pass runs on whole surfaces (blocks are not
4x4) and costs 0.8-4.1 s per Kodak image on one thread, 13-46× the effort-0 encode; it parallelizes across 16
KiB chunks like the other formats' passes. The cached refit sums and the re-weight and copy bounds made it
1.22-1.43× / 1.49-1.75× / 1.70-1.89× faster at 4x4 / 6x6 / 8x8 over the λ range, output byte-identical (6727c53
on the same core: 67-93 s / 54-71 s / 52-64 s).

## Lossless field split (`--prep`)

`src/prep.rs` applies a BC7Prep-style lossless transform before Zstd: blocks are split into byte streams of
like fields (BC1: endpoint low/high bytes and selectors; BC4/BC5: endpoints and indices; BC7: mode, shape,
endpoints with p-bits folded in, shared p-bits, bit-packed indices and an escape stream for invalid blocks).
`mipple encode --zstd N --prep on|auto` stores it in KTX2 with a `mipple.prep` key/value entry (one flag per
level) and `ktx2::read` undoes it; `auto` keeps whichever layout compresses smaller per level. Loaders that
do not know the key must not read prepped files. Zstd-19 size change on Kodak 1-6 (`cargo test --release
prep::tests::sizes -- --ignored --nocapture`):

| Format | λ 0 | λ 1 | λ 4 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BC1 | −4.95% | −3.18% | +2.12% |
| BC4 | −3.88% | −1.08% | +3.23% |
| BC5 | −5.03% | −1.75% | +2.95% |
| BC7 | −7.66% | −5.21% | −1.09% |

At high λ, RDO has optimized whole-block repeats in the interleaved layout and splitting them loses; an RDO
rate model for the split layout is on the roadmap.

## v0.9: entropy-reduced BC7 base encoding

v0.9 ports bc7enc's `-e` ("reduced entropy") into the BC7 base encoder, behind `--entropy off|on|auto`
(default **auto** = on for λ ≥ 1). It was measured with `mipple check`; the competitor tables above include it.

What it does, per block:

- **Mode-6 preference:** another mode must have less than 0.4× mode 6's error (0.6× with alpha) to win.
  Mode 6 is one subset, 4-bit indices and a fixed layout, so neighbouring blocks share more bytes.
- **Mode-6 endpoint quantization:** each 7-bit endpoint is limited to 64 evenly spaced levels with fixed
  p-bits ((1, 1) for opaque blocks so alpha stays exactly 255; (0, 1) with alpha, as bc7enc does).
- **RDO keeps it:** when RDO refits endpoints onto a neighbour's indices, it uses the same restricted
  quantization (worth a further −0.4% BD-rate on Kodak).

Which parts help, as BD-rate vs plain encoding (Zstd-19, λ 0–4, `--entropy on`; negative = smaller at equal PSNR):

| Variant | Kodak first 4 | Synthetic 256² |
| --- | --- | --- |
| bc7enc `-e` as published (weights 0.4/0.6, mode-6 quant, p-bit-1 weight 1.3) | −3.35% | −3.09% |
| p-bit-1 weight 1.3 only | +0.53% | −0.19% |
| mode-6 quantization only | +5.00% | +1.30% |
| mode weights 0.4/0.6 only | −3.25% | −1.67% |
| weights 0.6/0.8 + quant + p-bit | −1.08% | −0.24% |
| weights 0.8/0.9 + quant + p-bit | +2.19% | +0.76% |
| weights 0.25/0.4 + quant + p-bit | −3.34% | −4.44% |
| **weights 0.4/0.6 + quant, RDO keeps the quantization (shipped)** | **−3.70%** | **−4.88%** |

The mode weights do most of the work. The quantization only pays when the mode weights put enough blocks in
mode 6, and when RDO keeps it. The p-bit weighting made no difference once mode 6 was quantized, so it is not
included.

**When it pays.** Dense λ sweep (0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8), pooled PSNR vs Zstd-19 bytes:

| λ | Kodak-4 off | Kodak-4 on | Synthetic off | Synthetic on |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 45.78 dB, 1,418,246 B | 44.12 dB, 1,237,481 B | 45.13 dB, 266,899 B | 43.23 dB, 243,328 B |
| 0.5 | 44.74 dB, 1,235,712 B | 43.50 dB, 1,099,729 B | 44.65 dB, 228,517 B | 42.95 dB, 214,088 B |
| 1 | 43.36 dB, 1,086,535 B | 42.39 dB, 966,324 B | 44.16 dB, 221,299 B | 42.51 dB, 206,230 B |
| 2 | 41.61 dB, 943,867 B | 40.75 dB, 821,604 B | 42.87 dB, 209,834 B | 41.37 dB, 190,525 B |
| 4 | 40.21 dB, 859,850 B | 39.09 dB, 714,449 B | 40.63 dB, 193,037 B | 39.21 dB, 164,876 B |
| 8 | 39.33 dB, 830,667 B | 37.95 dB, 666,483 B | 38.15 dB, 167,913 B | 37.17 dB, 139,298 B |

Over the whole sweep, entropy reduction is −5.1% (Kodak-4) and −5.3% (synthetic) BD-rate. The curves
cross, though. Above about 43.5 dB (Kodak) or 42.5 dB (synthetic), plain encoding plus light RDO reaches the
same PSNR in fewer bytes. For example, plain λ = 0.5 gives 44.74 dB in 1.236 MB, while reduced λ = 0 gives
44.12 dB in 1.237 MB. Below the crossover, entropy reduction wins by 4–15%. Hence `auto` switches it on
from λ = 1:

- λ < 1 output is byte-identical to v0.2.
- On the check corpora, `auto` is −3.2% (Kodak-4) and −3.3% (synthetic) BD-rate vs v0.2, with λ 0–4.
  BD-rate understates it a little, because the cubic fit has to bend through the switch point.

**λ means something different from v0.2 at λ ≥ 1.** On Kodak-4, λ = 1 is now 42.4 dB (it was 43.4 dB) at
11% fewer bytes. Use `--entropy off` for v0.2 behaviour.

## Regression check (`mipple check`)

`mipple check` is the fast guard to run instead of re-running this page. It encodes the six synthetic images at
256² in all four formats at λ 0, 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 (about 27 s on the 2-core dev VM; Kodak first 4 for BC7: about
36 s). It compares the result with `bench-results/check-baseline.csv` (or `check-baseline-kodak.csv`) and
fails on:

- BD-rate > +1%;
- λ = 0 pooled PSNR −0.1 dB, or λ = 0 size +1%;
- any single image −0.5 dB at λ = 0.

How the check judged this release's changes:

| Change | Check result |
| --- | --- |
| `BlockOpts` refactor (effort + flag threaded through every encoder) | PASS, 120/120 encodes byte-identical |
| `--entropy on` | FAIL: λ = 0 PSNR −1.9 dB (gate working as intended: base quality traded for size), BD-rate −3.1% |
| `--entropy auto` (shipped default) | PASS: BC1/BC4/BC5 identical, BC7 BD-rate −3.28% (synthetic) / −3.23% (Kodak-4), λ < 1 identical |

Both baselines were then regenerated with `--update-baseline`.

Building bc7enc_rdo with recent GCC needs `-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-include cstdint"`; add `-DSUPPORT_BC7E=TRUE`
with ISPC on your PATH for its full-strength base encoder.
